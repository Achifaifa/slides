Grammar

Rule 0     S' -> stat
Rule 1     stat -> list
Rule 2     stat -> search
Rule 3     stat -> wargs
Rule 4     list -> LIST
Rule 5     wargs -> SHOW ID

Terminals, with rules where they appear

ID                   : 5
LIST                 : 4
SEARCH               : 6
SHOW                 : 5
WORD                 : 6
error                : 

Nonterminals, with rules where they appear

list                 : 1
search               : 2
stat                 : 0
wargs                : 3

Parsing method: LALR

state 0

    (0) S' -> . stat
    (1) stat -> . list
    (2) stat -> . search
    (3) stat -> . wargs
    (4) list -> . LIST
    (6) search -> . SEARCH WORD
    (5) wargs -> . SHOW ID

    LIST            shift and go to state 6
    SEARCH          shift and go to state 3
    SHOW            shift and go to state 5

    wargs                          shift and go to state 1
    stat                           shift and go to state 2
    list                           shift and go to state 4
    search                         shift and go to state 7
